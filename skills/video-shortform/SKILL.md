  Short-form video generation skill — 3-10 second clips for product
  reveals, motion teasers, ambient loops. Defaults to Seedance 2 but
  works the same with Kling 3 / 4, Veo 3 or Sora 2. Output is one MP4
  saved to the project folder. When the workspace also ships an
  interactive-video / hyperframes skill, prefer composing several short
  shots into a single timeline rather than one long monolithic clip.

# Video Shortform Skill

Short-form (≤ 10s) is the sweet spot for current text-to-video models —
they're great at one **shot** with one **idea**, weaker at multi-cut
narratives. Plan one shot per call.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Read the project metadata

`videoModel`, `videoLength` (seconds), `videoAspect`. These are
hard-locks — clamp the prompt to whatever the chosen model supports
(Seedance 2 caps at 10s; Kling 4 supports up to 10s + image-to-video;
Veo 3 supports 8s with audio).

### Step 1 — Plan the shot

Write the shotlist BEFORE calling the model:

| Slot | Content |
|---|---|
| Subject | What's in frame? |
| Camera | Static / pan / push-in / orbit? |
| Lighting | Key direction + temperature |
| Motion | What moves, at what pace? Subject motion vs camera motion. |
| Sound | Ambient bed? (only if the model supports audio) |

**Motion budget (load-bearing).** Current text-to-video models
(Seedance 2, Kling 3 / 4, Veo 3, Sora 2) handle **1–2 distinct motion
elements** per shot reliably. A third element starts to drift and a
fourth almost always freezes one of the subjects or warps the scene.
"Character walks left while car drives right while leaves blow while
camera pushes in" is a four-element ask — pick the *one* motion that
carries the idea (usually the subject) and let the rest stay still.
If the user really wants multi-element motion, suggest splitting it
into two shots and stitching them in a hyperframes / interactive-video
project.

Show this to the user as a one-sentence plan before dispatching — they
can redirect cheaply.

### Step 2 — Compose the prompt

Use the format the upstream model prefers (Seedance: motion + camera +
mood; Kling: subject + camera + style; Veo: subject + cinematography +
sound). Bind the project's `videoAspect` and `videoLength` directly to
the API parameters; never put them in prose.

### Step 3 — Dispatch via the media contract

Use the unified dispatcher — do **not** call provider APIs by hand:

```bash
node "$OD_BIN" media generate \
  --project "$OD_PROJECT_ID" \
  --surface video \
  --model "<videoModel from metadata>" \
  --aspect "<videoAspect from metadata>" \
  --length <videoLength seconds> \
  --output "<short-slug>-<seconds>s.mp4" \
  --prompt "<assembled shot prompt from Step 2>"
```

The command prints one line of JSON: `{"file": {"name": "...", ...}}`.
The bytes land in the project; the FileViewer plays it automatically.

### Step 4 — Hand off

Reply with: shot summary, the filename returned by the dispatcher, and
one sentence on what to try if the user wants a variation.

## Hard rules

- One shot per turn. Multi-shot timelines belong in a hyperframes /
  interactive-video skill, not here.
- Match `videoAspect` exactly — re-renders are slow.
- Never ship a video without saving the file — the user expects
  something to play in the file viewer.
- When the underlying model fails (NSFW filter, content policy,
  timeout), report the error verbatim. Don't silently retry.
